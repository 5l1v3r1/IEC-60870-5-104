We can add up to 50 server node in the simulator. Every server node will work independently. 
Simulator window shows the status & connection IP Address, port number, redundancy enabled or not,If Redundancy enabled it shows, the redundant source ip address, port . 
The user can update the monitoring Point information, and quality bits. Send all type of commands, parameter activation, file transfer.

Tested with all leading commercial test tools.
