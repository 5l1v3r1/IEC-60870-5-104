IEC-60870-5-104 Protocol IED RTU Server Simulator

Complete Simulation of IEC 104 Server RTU as per Protocol Standard including File transfer (Both Monitoring and control direction).

Add up to 50 server node in the simulator. Every server node will work independently.

Tested with all leading commercial test tools.

Support all type of Typeid ASDU, APCI, APDU, Command activation and termination commands. support all Cause of transmission (COT), Parameter in control direction.
